# freeload
The intent of this software is to provide an open, extensible framework for reloaders to manage and
share their load data. The general outline of the program is as follows:

1. Load data management
Users will be able to create, save, and load files containing reported velocities and accuracies for
load data with any arbitrary combination of features such as powder, bullet weight, bullet type,
primer, brass, barrel length, action, make, model, etc. The intent is for the data in this program to
be intuitive, portable, and readily modifiable. Users will be able to create their own data and import
the data of others to create a personalized database of load information with a suite of tools to sort
through and modify the information within.

2. Analysis tools
Using known information about brass contruction, bullet construction, and stored load data this program
will provide the user with additional details that may make the reloading process easier. For instance,
what is the impact of overall bullet length on the powder capacity of a case, and how might reducing the 
load outside of the known min-max affect the bullet velocities and pressures in the gun?  How well will 
load data at one barrel length extend to other barrel lengths? 

3. Data preparation and printing
Users will be able to output tables containing the data calculated in a visually appealing format.
